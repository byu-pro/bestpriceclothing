      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage is important, no question about that. Its the first impression a brand gets to make, and usually is the first page I will tackle in my design. The homepage will include promotions, branded lifestyle imagery, and featured products or categories. 
        Included will also be product image galleries, Value propositions which are clear, like what makes the brand or products unique, and my brand guarantees options like free shipping worldwide which will be highlighted. 

        I am also keeping in mind that people dont always enter through the homepage and may arrive via direct links to other pages.

      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>About Page</h3>
      <p>
        The main elements of this page will be to say what my business does in a way that is easy to understand, great Images that show I am a legitimate business, easy to understand and relatable. It will also Include a call to action. 

        My objective is that the page establishes a rapport that will lead to them being a client. I imagine my about us page as a speed-dating session with a possible consumer. They're looking for the proper company, and I just have a few seconds to impress them. It will state what items or services my company offers. My objective is also to communicate my main business in plain English in an interesting and understandable manner. I'll incorporate photographs that are both visually appealing and relevant to my company's mission.

      </ul>
      <h3>Shop Page</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes referred to as the Product Page, this is the individual view of a product with the full product details and pricing. The main call to action is the add-to-cart button. Adding reviews, related products, and user-generated content from social media is also present in this page to help drive customers to add-to-cart. It is the landing page for a top-level category, such as Women or Electronics, which displays an overview of whatâ€™s within that category rather than list all the products. 

        Multiple Category Overview pages may be used if there are more than two levels, such as Women's > Tops > Sweaters. However, if the categories are only one level deep, one can skip the category overview page and go straight to the category page.

    <h3>Contact Page</h3>
    <p>
        This page is meant to give my customers a centralized place to find ways to get in touch with customer support whether with an email address, phone number, form, or live chat with a Help or Contact Us page. Many sites combine FAQs with Contact Us to provide answers to questions that may have come up many times in the past (and also to save time).  

        The contact us page is very important in the sense that customer service is a huge driver for business growth, and making customer service accessible and easy will provide a superior experience to users and get people to spread the word about the store and brand.
